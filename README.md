# Quiz App

## Description
This project is a quiz application designed to test users' knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals + General knowledge questions for added fun. It features a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. Users can progress through the quiz, answering questions and receiving immediate feedback on their choices. At the end of the quiz, users can save their scores along with their initials.

## User Story
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Development Journey
The first thing I had to do was to break the task into it's constituent parts. For this I referred to the user story and acceptance criteris as well as some sketching out of the steps required to succeed.

- Timer Intervals
- Quiz Questions 'Questions as well as answers.'
- Buttons (Event Listener)
- If statements (if answers is wrong take off 5 seconds - if answer is right do nothing 'Either way display message wrong/correct' )
- Alerts/Display Messages
- DOM manipulation
- Events
- Local Storage (High Scores and recording Scorers (by initial))

## Usage
1. Click the "Start" button to begin the quiz.
2. Answer each question by selecting one of the provided choices.
3. If the answer is correct, proceed to the next question. If incorrect, time will be deducted.
4. Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz ends, and the final score is displayed.
5. Enter your initials and click "Submit" to save your score.
6. Click "Go Back" to return to the start screen.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Local Storage

## Further Development
To further add on to this project, I would focus on adding the "Clear Highscores" functionality.
